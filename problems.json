    "assignment": "Consider a fair coin and two players Alice and Bob. They flip a coin \\(N\\)-times. Alice gets a point for each pair of two consecutive heads \\(\\mathsf{HH}\\), including cases where heads overlap (i.e., \\(\\mathsf{HHH}\\) yields two points). Bob gets a point for each pair of heads followed by tails \\(\\mathsf{HT}\\). The winner is a player who scored more points. On average, who wins more games? What are the respective win rates and how much percent of games ends in a draw?",

Each second, the walker takes a \\(1\\,\\text{m}\\) step with equal probability to the left or to the right. If the walker reaches the left end of the bridge, he falls off. What is the probability that the walker falls off the bridge on the left side (in the limit of infinite time)?"
