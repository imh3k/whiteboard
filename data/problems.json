    "assignment": "Consider a fair coin and two players Alice and Bob. They flip a coin \\(N\\)-times. Alice gets a point for each pair of two consecutive heads \\(\\mathsf{HH}\\), including cases where heads overlap (i.e., \\(\\mathsf{HHH}\\) yields two points). Bob gets a point for each pair of heads followed by tails \\(\\mathsf{HT}\\). The winner is a player who scored more points. On average, who wins more games? What are the respective win rates and how much percent of games ends in a draw?",

Each second, the walker takes a \\(1\\,\\text{m}\\) step with equal probability to the left or to the right. If the walker reaches the left end of the bridge, he falls off.
