Alice gets a point for each pair of two consecutive heads \\(\\mathsf{HH}\\), including cases where heads overlap (i.e., \\(\\mathsf{HHH}\\) yields two points). Bob gets a point for each pair of heads followed by tails \\(\\mathsf{HT}\\). The winner is a player who scored more points. On average, who wins more games? What are the respective win rates and how much percent of games ends in a draw?",
