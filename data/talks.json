    "description": "The operators in an Effective Field Theory Lagrangian satisfy various relations that arise from equations of motion, integration by parts, and finite-dimensionality conditions. These relations can be systematically handled using group-theoretic techniques implemented in the so-called Hilbert series method, which enables us to compute a generating function that encodes the number of independent operators with a given number of derivatives and particle fields."
