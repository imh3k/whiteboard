    "description": "Most physicists are familiar with real projective 3-space \\(\\mathbb{RP}^3\\) through the study of the group \\(SO(3)\\), or with complex projective space as represented by the Bloch sphere. In this talk, we will demonstrate how real projective space, along with its connection to the real space of one higher dimension, enables a description of geometric primitives that allows for writing formulas, statements, and transformations in a more general and unified manner. We will illustrate how this framework addresses the challenge of working with parallel lines, and clarify the statement that \"parallel lines intersect at infinity.\" Equipped with this algebraic-geometric framework, we will then explore how to find a mathematical model of a camera, and showcase its power in pose estimation—the task of determining position in 3D space from a camera image."

    "description": "How much time does it take to multiply two \\n\\ digits long numbers? When one uses the algorithm taught in middle schools, she quickly finds the \\(\\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\) time complexity. Can we do better? Utilizing 'devide and conquer' strategy and one neat trick we arrive at roughly\\(\\mathcal{O}(n^1.585)\\). Furthermore, we show that we can go as low as \\(\\mathcal{O}(n^(1+\\epsilon))\\), which begs the question: 'Is multiplication as hard/easy as summation?'. We finally argue that true complexity seems to be \\(\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)\\)."

    "description": "A large class of problems (in combinatorics, but also for example in QFT — notably Feynman diagrams) can be formulated as a sum over certain class of graphs, with weights that factorize for disjoint unions of graphs (with addition of implicit \"symmetry factors\"). Factorization of weights enables us to first decompose the graph into \"connected\" components, then perform the calculation independently on every component, and multiply the contributions at the end (often in combinatorics, when enumerating number of ways to carry out a certain task on an \\(n\\)-element set, we can first make all admissible partitions of the original set into blocks, and carry out the task on each block independently). <br> We will derive and demonstrate on examples the relation \\(\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{\\substack{\\text{all graphs}\\,G \\\\ \\text{for a given problem}}} \\frac{1}{|\\text{Aut}\\,G|} w[G] = \\exp\\left( \\sum\\limits_{\\substack{\\text{connected} \\\\ \\text{graphs}\\,\\gamma}}\\frac{1}{|\\text{Aut}\\,\\gamma|} w[\\gamma] \\right) \\), in words \"Exponential map generates contributions of all graphs from just the connected ones, with correct weights and symmetric factors.\" One can often extract interesting results from this relation, or immediately simplify the calculation to a more manageable set of contributions (just connected graphs instead of all graphs)."

    "description": "Cytoskeletal filaments — microtubules and actin — are an indispensable component of all living cells. One can imagine them as long ropes or sticks composed of smaller subunits, creating highly organized networks in cells. Their regulated dynamic assembly and disassembly can lead to creation of mechanical forces at the cellular scale, which is utilized in many various life-essential processes, including cellular movement (sperms, neurons, immune cells), cell division, or transport of inner material. Cytoskeleton also provides cells a resistance to external mechanical stresses. Improper functioning of cytoskeleton can lead to serious diseases as Alzheimer or all kinds of cancers, hence it is an important topic for biological research."

    "description": "A paper recently uploaded to ArXiv proposes an alternative to Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) that plays a crucial role as a fundamental building block of many architectures. While MLPs are theoretically backed by a universal approximation theorem consisting of a fixed activation function with learnable weights, newly proposed KANs build upon a K-A representation theorem, making the activation functions learnable. We will explore both theorems and show how the paper mentioned uses Bezier curves and b-splines to represent an activation function. We will demonstrate some strengths of this alternative approach, namely \"locality\" and better interpretability.",

These relations can be systematically handled using group-theoretic techniques implemented in the so-called Hilbert series method, which enables us to compute a generating function that encodes the number of independent operators with a given number of derivatives and particle fields."
